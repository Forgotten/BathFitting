# BathFitting
Bath Fitting via Semidefinite relaxation

This is a python implementation of the semidefinite relaxation for bath fitting in C. Mejuto-Zaera, L. Zepeda-Núñez, M. Lindsey, N. Tubman, B. Whaley, and L. Lin Efficient hybridization Fitting for dynamical mean-field theory via semi-definite relaxation, Phys. Rev. B 101, 035143, 2020.

## Requirements: 

-cvxpy > 1.0

-numpy

-scipy 

For some of the examples we will use the h5py library to extract the data (already contained in the tests folder)

## Installation

To install just go to the main directory and install as usual: 

python setup.py install

This will install the package on your local python environment (we strongly recommend to create a virtual environment before hand)/

## Tests
